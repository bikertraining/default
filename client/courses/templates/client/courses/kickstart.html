                    The KickStart Course is for students that have not reached a level of comfort that will enable them
                    to continue with the course. True novice riders may find the slower pace helpful when learning the
                    initial control skills and gain greater comfort and familiarity with the motorcycle. It is a 2-3
                    hour, first-touch experience with a motorcycle and not designed to teach a person to ride. Also
                    embedded in the experience is a self-assessment component to ensure a person is aware of the risks
                    and requirements for being a good, safe and responsible rider.
