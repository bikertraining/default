                    This one day course, typically held on Sundays, is for riders who already own and ride a motorcycle
                    and are interested in state-of-the-art motorcycle handling techniques or for brushing up on their
                    safe street riding skills. Increasing numbers of seasoned riders are coming to the Skilled
                    RiderCourse to fine-tune their riding and mental skills needed for survival in traffic.

                <div class="mt-3">
                    You'll discuss with your peers how to balance the mental and physical aspects of safe riding,
                    managing risk, increasing visibility and optimizing lane position. The course also covers protective
                    gear, rider responsibility, motorcycle inspection and care, and the effects of alcohol and other
                    drugs on riding.

                <div class="mt-3">
                    On the range, using your own motorcycle, you will put into practice intense riding activities,
                    including the techniques of managing traction, slow speed handling, stopping quickly, cornering and
                    swerving.
