                    This course is designed for beginning riders of all ages. The 3-wheel Basic RiderCourse consists of
                    12 hours of instruction including approximately 5 hours using the online self-paced ePackage-1
                    eCourse and 7 hours of riding on the parking lot range. This course will teach you how to safely
                    operate a 3-wheel motorcycle and strongly emphasizes the special skills and mental attitude required
                    for dealing with every day riding.

                    You will learn about different types of motorcycles, their controls, and how they operate. The Rider
                    Coaches, all experienced professionals, will advise you on the proper riding gear to ensure comfort
                    and protection. You will also learn how alcohol and other drugs affect your ability to ride safely.

                <div class="mt-3">
                    The range is a controlled, off-street, pedestrian-free environment. Students will learn and practice
                    safely and correctly the various maneuvers and demanding situations encountered in street riding.
                    Riders must pass both a written test and a riding skills test in order to complete the course. Upon
                    successful completion, you will have met the State’s training requirement for obtaining a 3-wheel
                    motorcycle endorsement at the driver's license office.
